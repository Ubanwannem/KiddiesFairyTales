  <h3> Fairy Tales That Teach Children Respect For Nature.</h3>

  <p>The Two Little Fairies in the Forest by Aradhana. S.</p>
<p>  <em>
Once there lived a fairy inside a flower bud. Oh yes! She was a flower fairy. Her name is Lyla. She was little like Thumbelina. One day she wanted to see the whole world because she lived in a garden full of flowers. She had another friend, her name was Lily. She was very kind just like Lyla. One day when Lyla thought of going to see the world, Lily was writing something in her note. So Lyla decided to go alone. When she went, she discovered a lot of things. She flew too far and went into the forest. She was flying very deep that she looked back to see if something was chasing her. While she turned back, she hit a tree and fell down. She was okay. She walked to see if she could discover something. She saw a lot of trees. A few miles later she saw a lioness. She asked "What is your name?" The Lioness said "My name is Lia". They talked too much and they became friends. One day she thought about her friend Lily. She asked "Lia, can I please introduce my friend to you?" Lia said "OK but quick before it gets night". Lyla said "Ok". She went in the morning and returned in the evening. They all chatted together.

One day the Lion came with food for Lia. The lion's name was David. He went and killed the animals for eating. When he came back to the lioness he saw the two fairies. He whispered in the lioness's ears "Lia, today night we will kill these fairies and eat them." The lioness said, "No David, they are my friends". The lion said "Oh! okay then I will not kill them but I will give food for them". Lia said "ok". Then Lia asked the fairies "what would you guys eat?" Lyla and Lily said "Flowers and fruits". So every day the Lion looked for animals to kill and eat and also fruits and flowers for the fairies. They had a lovely life together. They were the best family ever you can imagine.</em>

<p>
  The Forest Fairies and the Dark Mist by  Elizabeth Hromada
</p>
<em>
  This is a lovely pedagogical story written by one of our Early Childhood teachers specifically for this time. Therapeutic stories work best when we don’t tell the children that it is reflective of their own experience, but rather allow them to think about the story on their own and to process it in a subconscious way.

Once upon a time, there was a brilliant and beautiful rainbow that shone across the sky every day over an enchanted forest filled with trees that sparkled like green jewels. In each tree lived families of tree fairies. They were a happy community filled with grandma & grandpa fairies, mommy & daddy fairies, child fairies, and of course, many baby fairies.

Each day, all the child fairies would gather in the small meadow at the edge of the forest. There they would play together, dance & sing together, enjoy puppet stories, and snack together too. They delighted in their days, and loved each other very much.

Then, one night when all the fairy families slept, it seemed as though the clouds fell from the sky, for the whole forest was blanketed by a thick dark mist. Well, just like every morning in the fairy forest, the first ones to wake were the elders, the grandma and grandpa fairies. When they went outside to greet the morning sun and give thanks for the new day, they were surprised to find that they could not see anything but a thick dark mist. The mist made it hard for them to breathe, and the grandma and grandpa fairies grew quite ill.
The mommy and daddy fairies took care of the elders, and they learned that anyone who went into the thick dark mist became ill. So, all the fairies, the mommys, the daddys, the children, and the babies stayed in their tree homes while the thick dark mist remained in the forest. The child fairies missed their friends and missed the meadow where they loved to play, but soon found new ways to play on their own and with their brothers and sisters.

They imagined they were in the meadow, and they imagined they were forest creatures, and they imagined many other wonderful games. They made beautiful art with flowers and sticks, moss and bark, seeds and leaves, paints and clay. Most of all, the children loved helping. They worked around their houses, singing with their mommys and daddys. They helped to make meals, set the table, wash dishes, sweep the floors, dust the shelves, scrub the windows, and take care of the growing plants, and they loved their families very much. And while they still missed going to the meadow, the child fairies had so much fun finding new ways to enjoy the days!

Many, many, many days passed, and then one day, a child fairy woke up, looked out the window, and saw for the first time in a long time, bright rays of sunlight shining through the trees! The thick dark mist left at last!

The mommy and daddy fairies went outside to see, and they found they could breathe clean fresh air. The whole community flew outside, and cheers of laughter and rejoicing rang out through the forest. Once again the brilliant and beautiful rainbow was shining above them all.

The children leapt into the air with joy and flew to the meadow to play together, dance & sing together, enjoy puppet stories, and snack together too. They spent the whole day together until, at last, it was time to return to their homes to be with their loving families.

And this is the way it still is today, if it ever was.

<p>The Adventures of Lily and the Enchanted Forest by Romanus Gari.</p>

<em>Once upon a time, in a small town named Greenfield, there lived a little girl named Lily. Lily was a kind-hearted and curious child who loved spending time outdoors, especially in the local park. One sunny morning, she woke up early, filled with excitement, as her parents had promised to take her on a special adventure in the Enchanted Forest.
Lily and her parents arrived at the park, where they were greeted by the park ranger, Mr. Oakwood. He welcomed them and reminded them of the park rules to ensure everyone's safety and the well-being of the environment. Lily listened carefully as Mr. Oakwood explained the importance of staying on designated paths, not littering, and respecting the plants and animals.
Eager to explore, Lily began walking along the winding trails of the Enchanted Forest. As she strolled, she encountered various magical creatures. The first creature she met was a graceful deer named Daisy. Daisy had a beautiful set of antlers and a gentle smile. Lily couldn't help but ask, "Daisy, what should we do if we see litter in the park?"
Daisy looked at Lily and replied, "Oh, dear child, if you spot litter, pick it up and dispose of it in the nearest trash bin. Remember, it's our responsibility to keep our forest clean and protect the creatures who call it home."
Thanking Daisy, Lily continued her adventure. Soon, she stumbled upon a wise old owl perched on a tree branch. The owl introduced himself as Oliver and had a wealth of knowledge about the forest. Intrigued, Lily asked, "Oliver, what should we do if we see a fragile flower or plant?"
Oliver hooted softly and responded, "Young one, when you encounter a delicate flower or plant, admire its beauty but do not pick or trample upon it. Nature's wonders deserve our care and protection, so they can continue to flourish for generations to come."
Lily nodded, grateful for the owl's wisdom, and continued her journey deeper into the Enchanted Forest. She soon came across a mischievous squirrel named Sammy, who was busy gathering acorns. Lily smiled and asked, "Sammy, can you tell me what we should do if we hear a bird singing or spot a squirrel like you?"
Sammy paused, looking mischievously at Lily before replying, "Listen up, kiddo! When you hear a bird's song or see a squirrel scampering about, remember to be quiet and observe from a distance. We all love our homes, and it's essential to respect our fellow forest dwellers."
Lily thanked Sammy and continued exploring; using her newly acquired knowledge of the park rules and the imperative verbs she had learned from her encounters with Daisy, Oliver, and Sammy. She admired the vibrant flowers, listened to the melodious bird songs, and marveled at the wonders of nature.
As the day drew to a close, Lily and her parents headed back home, filled with joy and a newfound appreciation for nature's beauty. Lily shared her adventures with her friends, encouraging them to explore the Enchanted Forest while respecting the park rules and treating nature with care.

<p>"The Magic Meadow child"by Ekene John.</p>
<em>Once upon a time, in a small village nestled at the edge of a mystical forest, there lived a young girl named Emily. Emily was full of curiosity and had a deep love for nature. One sunny morning, she ventured into the forest, drawn by the whispers of the wind and the enchanting melodies of birds.

As Emily explored deeper into the woods, she stumbled upon a hidden meadow bursting with colorful flowers and shimmering butterflies. The meadow seemed magical, as if it held secrets waiting to be discovered. Just as Emily was about to step into the meadow, a gentle voice echoed through the air.

"Stop, dear child," the voice whispered. Emily turned around to see a wise old tree standing tall nearby. The tree, named Elderwood, spoke with warmth and wisdom. "Before you enter the meadow, let me share some important rules to protect this magical place."

Emily listened attentively as Elderwood explained that in the meadow, she must tread lightly, for every step she took affected the delicate balance of nature. She must refrain from picking the flowers, for they needed to bloom and bring joy to all who beheld them. And most importantly, she must cherish and respect the creatures that called the meadow home.

With the rules in mind, Emily stepped into the meadow, feeling the soft grass beneath her feet and the warm sunshine on her face. As she explored, she encountered a friendly rabbit named Clover, who hopped up to her with a twinkle in its eyes.

"Hello, Emily!" Clover greeted her. "Remember, if you spot a fallen branch or litter in the meadow, kindly remove it and keep this haven clean for all to enjoy."

Emily nodded gratefully, acknowledging the rabbit's advice. She continued her journey, and soon she encountered a graceful butterfly named Aurora, fluttering gracefully among the flowers.

"Dear Emily," Aurora whispered gently, "when you hear the birds singing their melodious tunes, pause and listen, for they bring harmony to this magical place."

Emily smiled, realizing the importance of being still and appreciating the wonders of nature. She thanked Aurora and continued her exploration of the meadow.

As the day came to a close, Emily found herself at the meadow's heart, where a sparkling stream flowed. She knelt down to drink from the clear waters, and to her surprise, a tiny fairy named Willow emerged from the stream.

"Emily," Willow's voice tinkled like bells, "when you leave the meadow, remember to carry its magic within your heart. Spread the love for nature wherever you go, and protect and care for the natural world as if it were this very meadow."

Emily's heart swelled with gratitude for the wisdom she had gained from Elderwood, Clover, Aurora, and Willow. With a renewed sense of purpose, she bid farewell to the magical meadow and returned to her village, ready to share her newfound knowledge and inspire others to cherish and preserve nature's wonders.

And so, dear children, let Emily's story be a reminder to treasure the beauty of the natural world, respect its delicate balance, and carry its magic within your hearts always.</em></p>

<p>Milly And The Rainbow</p>
<p>
  <em> Milly sat under the apple tree and watched the rain clouds sweep over the hills. What a wet day!

She ate an apple and waited for the rain to stop. Soon it did. The sky turned blue again, and the Sun shone, warm and golden.

Then she saw the rainbow. It began as an explosion of light, high in the clouds. The sky filled with dazzling colours: blue, orange, green and purple. Then both ends of the rainbow began to fall to Earth...

The rainbow landed in the garden.

‘Wow!’ Milly went closer and touched the rainbow. She felt nothing, just air. But the colours moved beneath her fingers.

When she looked up, the rainbow seemed to be stretching on and on into space.

'What would happen if I stepped inside it?' she wondered. There was only one way to find out...

She stepped inside.

It was beautiful! And very quiet. Milly couldn’t hear anything.

She looked up. The rainbow seemed to go on forever...

WHOOSH! Milly was sucked up by the rainbow. It was a tunnel of light. She whizzed along like a button up a vacuum cleaner. Wind whistled past her ears. She tumbled over and over but didn’t hurt herself: she was carried on a soft cushion of air. Up and up and up she went, so fast.

But rainbows go up... and rainbows come down. Soon she was falling down the far side of the rainbow. She could see green below. Green grass, rushing up to meet her, faster and faster...

BUMP! She landed hard, but nothing was broken.

Milly stood up. She was on the other side of the valley, standing on a steep green hill. She could see her house, far away. It was like a tiny white box with a rainbow in the garden. Everything was calm and peaceful and very lovely...

WHOOSH! Suddenly she was shooting back through the rainbow, faster than a firework. Red, blue, yellow ... stripes of light, flashing by.

Up, up, up she went and down, down, down... BUMP. She landed back in her own garden.

'Oww...!’ Milly groaned. ‘I am going to be so bruised tomorrow.'

Then she had a thought...

'GOLD! There is always gold at the end of a rainbow!'

She dropped to her knees and started to dig. The earth flew out behind her, covering the grass with stones and soil.
'Come on, come on! It must be here somewhere...'

She went deeper and deeper. Then she saw something shiny, under her fingertips. She pulled it out.

'Gold...'

Milly stared at it, breathless with excitement. It was a golden coin, bigger than usual money and much heavier. She rubbed it clean. There were words written on it:

Make a wish before the rainbow fades.

'Oh wow!' she said. 'This is amazing! A wish!'

Her head began to fill with ideas, everything she could wish for. But then she saw something. The rainbow was starting to fade. It was going thin at the edges.

'No! I haven't made up my mind! Please - wait!'

But the rainbow didn't wait. It was fading. Going away, and taking her wish with it.

'No! I’ll make my wish soon. Just a moment, please!'

But still the rainbow was fading. The golden coin was getting hot in her hand.

'Ohh....! Choose... choose... Yes. YES! I have it!'

Milly closed her eyes and made her wish and VOOMF! The rainbow disappeared, and so did the golden coin.

Milly hardly dared to move. Had her wish come true?

Maybe.

She looked up. The sky was peacock blue. The Sun was golden, warm on her face. Such a beautiful day. Such a beautiful world.

'Even if the wish doesn't come true, I am a very lucky girl,' she said. And she smiled.
